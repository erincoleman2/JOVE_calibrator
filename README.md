This repository contains supplemental information for my honors thesis "Building a Calibrator for Gustavus Radio JOVE". 
It includes a sample data file and a python file which, when run, extracts the ADC values corresponding to each
attenuation step from raw calibration data.

The Python file requires the following packages to run: scipy, numpy, pandas, datetime, uncertainties, and matplotlib.
